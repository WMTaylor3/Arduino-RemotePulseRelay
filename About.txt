Arduino Project #1. Pule Transmitter/Reciever.
Start Date: April 18th 2017
Completion Date: Not yet complete.
Refactoring/Cleaning: None.

Device intended to be used in pairs.
Records the user’s heartbeat and the exact intervals between them using a pulse sensor and transmits the information via MQTT over an ESP8266 to the other device.
At the other end, the pulse is recreated through the use of a haptic motor.
The same occurs simultaneously back the other way.

This project was my first (somewhat ambitious) attempt at working with Arduino.
As such it is incomplete, messy and will likely remain as such until I have sufficient time to revisit it.
I do wish to complete it though.
